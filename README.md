Builds on our investigation of singly linked lists by focusing on how one may delete a node in the linked list. We investigate two ways in which one may perform the deletion.

The first involves deleting a node in the list with a given key or data element. The second involves deleting a node in the list given a position in the list.

We proceed to implement these methods in Python.
